==========

The Wired Wiki provides a knowledge base that regroups all the well-know topics around the use of Wired. 
It is the first place to consider if you need documentation about Wired. The Wiki is also open-sourced 
and you can found that sources on GitHub, so it is easy take part of the documentation project 
if you want to. Feel free to send some pull requests.

The wiki engine used here is Markdoc ([http://markdoc.org](http://markdoc.org)), a jekyll-style static wiki generator written in Python. In few words, you give markdown formatted files to Markdoc, it builds a static HTML wiki website for you.

It makes it easy if you want to contribute to the wiki. All you have to do is to install Markdoc, clone this repository to update markdown formatted files, then send me pull-requests on GitHub. Changes will be validated then pushed to the website as HTML static pages.
